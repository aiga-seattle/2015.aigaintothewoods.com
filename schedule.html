          <h2>Getting to Leavenworth</h2>

          <p>A 2.5 hour drive from downtown Seattle, Leavenworth is a majestic drive through the Cascade Mountains. We recommend guests plan to leave early on Friday for arrival for check-in at 12:00noon.</p>

          <p>Air Travel: SeaTac Airport is accessible by all major airlines and is 13 miles south of downtown Seattle. Lightrail transportation services makes it an easy and affordable jump to/from the airport to all downtown hotels.</p>

          <p>Getting Around: We recommend planning your conference stay to arrive on Thursday and depart on Monday. This will give you ample drive time to/from Leavenworth. AIGA Seattle has hotel discounts at a few downtown hotels, please contact us if you are interested in reserving with our code.</p>

          <p>Ground Transportation: Best way to get to Leavenworth is by carpool. Sleeping Lady has ample onsite parking that is included in your conference fee. For out of town attendees, a car rental is required, or contact us and we can work with you to coordinate a chapter attendee carpool scenario.</p>
