<p>I'm a Filipino-American art director, designer and illustrator from the Pacific Northwest. I love bikes, dogs and design in no particular order.</p>

<p>I started my career as a poster designer for Seattle's vibrant music scene in the late 90's. Driven by my passion for music I crafted a distinct style comprised of integrated type and image. I've since moved on to become a distinguished illustrator and art director, working with some of the best agencies and talented creatives in the industry.</p>

<p>I worked at Specialized Bicycle Components, leading a talented and passionate team of bike aficionados in global marketing. When I'm not at work I'm probably out riding my bike. I'm an accomplished cross-country mountain bike racer, specializing in marathon distances, with two sub nine hour Leadville Traill 100 belt buckles to prove it.</p>

<p>I'm now an art director at Instrument, and living and working in Portland, OR with my loving wife and our crazy dog, Marlow.</p>
