<p>Andrio started his career as a poster designer for Seattle's vibrant music scene in the late 90's. Driven by my passion for music he crafted a distinct style comprised of integrated type and image. He's since moved on to become a distinguished illustrator and art director, working with some of the best agencies and talented creatives in the industry.</p>

<p>He is now an associate creative director at Instrument, an independent digital creative agency in Portland, Oregon. They are a multidisciplinary team of strategists, designers, producers, writers, code artists and filmmakers. They combine design thinking and technical craft for every screen. Clients include Nike, Google, Black Diamond, Levi's, Patagonia, TEDx and Specialized.

<p>When he's not at work he's probably out riding his bike. He is an accomplished cross-country mountain bike racer, specializing in marathon distances, with two sub nine hour Leadville Trail 100 belt buckles to prove it.</p>

<p>He love bikes, dogs and design in no particular order.</p>
