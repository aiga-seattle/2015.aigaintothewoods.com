<p>Andrio started his career as a poster designer for Seattle's vibrant music scene in the late 90's. Driven by my passion for music he crafted a distinct style comprised of integrated type and image. He's since moved on to become a distinguished illustrator and art director, working with some of the best agencies and talented creatives in the industry.</p>

<p>He is now an associate creative director at Instrument, an independent digital creative agency in Portland, Oregon. They are a multidisciplinary team of strategists, designers, producers, writers, code artists and filmmakers. They combine design thinking and technical craft for every screen.</p>

<p>When he's not at work he's probably out riding his bike. He is an accomplished cross-country mountain bike racer, specializing in marathon distances, with two sub nine hour Leadville Trail 100 belt buckles to prove it.</p>

<p>He love bikes, dogs and design in no particular order.</p>
