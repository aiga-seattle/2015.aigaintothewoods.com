            <p>Workshop brought by <a href="http://adobe.com">Adobe</a>.</p>

<p>With the advent of so many mobile devices, technology is offering more and more solutions to aid in our creative processes. In this workshop, we’ll discuss the creative process, then take a (short) walk in the woods to capture color, imagery, and more with your mobile device—that we’ll then incorporate directly into a design. Come take a walk outside, gain a new perspective for a design challenge, and learn a thing or two about using technology to aid your creative process.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="workshop-desc">
            <p>Too often designers are relegated to the aesthetic considerations: How something appears. When in fact the empathy and inherent curiosity of designers needed, vitally, to create remarkable experiences. This workshop gives designers a practical, hands-on approach to decode the true identity of brands. We will then discuss, develop and exercise skills to advance design beyond visual manipulation — to create soulful, original, complete and meaningful experiences.</p>

<p>A co-founder of Stoke, David Miller has a diverse background in strategic marketing and concept development for firms within the healthcare, financial service, professional service, manufacturing, technology and consumer product industries. Through research and strategic planning, David guides clients to the organizational change and market positioning that creates winning brands. With offices located in Seattle’s “Old Ballard” commercial district, Miller has led global brand design assignments for GE, Bluetooth, Honeywell, Starbucks, Colliers International, LG and Medtronic. </p>

          </div>

          <div class="workshop-desc">
            <p>A graphic designer since 1997, my focus has moved, through serendipity and lifelong fascination, to type design by implementing the craft of hand lettering. I also create a diverse selection of illustrative work.</p>

<p>My love of letters began when I was nine years old. I learned italic printing in elementary school, I pursued it further, teaching myself different calligraphic styles from any book I could find on the subject. In college, a professor pointed me to pages in a design book’s lettering section, and I swooned. Such an artistic and spontaneous task, with pen or brush pen or steel nib pen in hand, yet so controlled, as each letter perfectly approaches or intertwines with the next, in a flowing precision. An ageless craft yet, in the right hands, as effective in identity or messaging as the most modern method, as it subliminally adds a strongly human, and thus personal, element. I knew to my core that I'd found my lifework.</p>

<p>In September of 2010, I transitioned from freelance graphic design to typeface design. The intent of my typefaces is to create something unique and well designed, filling a niche in the vast marketplace of fonts, and offering several design possibilities through the addition of alternates, swashes and ornaments. I love creating letters and I aim to demonstrate that passion through my designs. My hope is that my typefaces will assist you in your creative endeavors.</p>

            <h2>The Workshop Workshop: Building the foundation for great projects with Leslie Ferguson</h2>
          </div>

          <div class="workshop-desc">
            <p>At the beginning of every project there is a unique moment to set the tone for the rest of the engagement and get everyone on the same page: the workshop. Knowing how to set up and run effective workshops is rarely taught in school and yet might be one of the highest-impact, lowest-effort skills you can learn to make you a better designer/manager/badass. In just a couple hours Leslie will teach a format and set of exercises to get disparate teams aligned, set expectations, build trust, and identify the foundational elements of whatever you’ll be building as a team.</p>

<p>Leslie is a senior user experience designer at Tectonic specializing in product strategy and envisioning. She has made a career of using her creative energy to influence and inspire teams through design. For balance, Leslie enjoys learning new things that don’t involve screens such as improv comedy, woodworking, abstract drawing and pottery.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="workshop-desc">
            <p>Ted Leonhardt cofounded The Leonhardt Group (TLG) a brand design agency, now Fitch, Seattle in 1985, with his wife and partner Carolyn Leonhardt. When they sold in 1999 the company had reached 50 employees and $10 million in annual fee sales. TLG worked with clients locally and globally and was widely featured in design publications, including Communication Arts, Graphic Design:USA and HOW.</p>

<p>TLG became part of Cordiant Communications Group in 2000. Ted and Carolyn moved to Europe where Ted served Cordiant’s design and branding group—Fitch:Worldwide—as Chief Creative Officer/Global in 2001 and 2002. His role included creative responsibility for 570 employees in 25 offices around the world. In 2003 Ted joined Schawk, Inc. where he held the position of President, Anthem Worldwide, a brand packaging consultancy with eight offices, through early 2005.</p>

<p>Ted has lectured and written on the subject of design and business for many organizations and publications including AIGA, APDF, IPA, PRSA, NIRI Communication Arts, How Magazine and Marketing. Today, Ted and Carolyn are consulting in the US and UK. They specialize in acquisitions, strategic positioning, partner communications, sales and marketing.</p>
