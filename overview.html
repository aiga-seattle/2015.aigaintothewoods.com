        <h2>History of Into the Woods</h2>

        <p>For twenty years, <strong>Into the Woods</strong> has cultivated unexpected insights and meaningful connections between both people and ideas in a retreat style atmosphere.</p>

        <p>In 1996, the very first Into the Woods was held at Lake Quinault Lodge, on the Olympic Peninsula in western Washington, and featured rustic atmosphere in the glacial-carved Quinault Valley. With a permanent move to the Sleeping Lady Mountain Resort, nestled in the Cascade Mountains in Leavenworth Washington, Into the Woods offers attendee’s majestic views and a cozy campus setting where we take over the campus for the entire 3-day event.</p>

        <p>Past Into the Woods Keynote Speakers: Steve Frykholm, Yves Behar, Kyle Cooper, Stefen Fangmeier, Paula Scher, Seymour Chwast, Craig Frazier, Ellen Lupton, Angela Adams, Rick Valicenti, Gail Anderson, Matthew Carter, Kit Hinrichs, Allan Cobb, Kate Bingaman-Burt, Howard Lichter, Jay Ryan, and many more.</p>
