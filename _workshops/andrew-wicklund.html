<p>Drawing has always come as a natural way of thinking and ideating for his design solutions, but it wasn’t until he put on a backpack and started exploring the world that he began to appreciate the true power of observational drawing. Stopping long enough to soak in a moment and capture it by putting pen to paper is a true mean of mediation. in 2010 he went on a 13-month hiatus from Hornall Anderson and traveled the world, filling 20 sketchbooks. He continued to fill his Moleskines while working in HA’s London office, and returned to Seattle three years ago and now works for himself.</p>

<p>Observational sketching is a means of capturing moments in a personal way—with the power to embed deep memories of place and time. Let go of the need to be perfect. Embrace the “mistakes” and let them be a part of the process. Drew’s workshop requires no drawing skills. He simply asks for your willingness to let go of your predisposition of “good” or “bad”.</p>
