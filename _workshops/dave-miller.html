<p>Too often designers are relegated to the aesthetic considerations: How something appears. When in fact the empathy and inherent curiosity of designers needed, vitally, to create remarkable experiences. This workshop gives designers a practical, hands-on approach to decode the true identity of brands. We will then discuss, develop and exercise skills to advance design beyond visual manipulation — to create soulful, original, complete and meaningful experiences.</p>
