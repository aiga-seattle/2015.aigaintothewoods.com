<p>A graphic designer since 1997, my focus has moved, through serendipity and lifelong fascination, to type design by implementing the craft of hand lettering. I also create a diverse selection of illustrative work.</p>

<p>My love of letters began when I was nine years old. I learned italic printing in elementary school, I pursued it further, teaching myself different calligraphic styles from any book I could find on the subject. In college, a professor pointed me to pages in a design bookâ€™s lettering section, and I swooned. Such an artistic and spontaneous task, with pen or brush pen or steel nib pen in hand, yet so controlled, as each letter perfectly approaches or intertwines with the next, in a flowing precision. An ageless craft yet, in the right hands, as effective in identity or messaging as the most modern method, as it subliminally adds a strongly human, and thus personal, element. I knew to my core that I'd found my lifework.</p>

<p>In September of 2010, I transitioned from freelance graphic design to typeface design. The intent of my typefaces is to create something unique and well designed, filling a niche in the vast marketplace of fonts, and offering several design possibilities through the addition of alternates, swashes and ornaments. I love creating letters and I aim to demonstrate that passion through my designs. My hope is that my typefaces will assist you in your creative endeavors.</p>
