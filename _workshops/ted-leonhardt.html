<p>If you’re a designer or writer, your enlarged right brain makes you an easy target for compromise when it comes to talking about the dollars, deadlines and other negotiable pieces of a project. But this is a tendency you can learn to overcome, especially under the guidance of Ted Leonhardt, creator of the Worth It skills learning program.</p>

<p>Ted Leonhardt cofounded The Leonhardt Group (TLG) a brand design agency, now Fitch, Seattle in 1985, with his wife and partner Carolyn Leonhardt. When they sold in 1999 the company had reached 50 employees and $10 million in annual fee sales. TLG worked with clients locally and globally and was widely featured in design publications, including Communication Arts, Graphic Design:USA and HOW.</p>

<p>TLG became part of Cordiant Communications Group in 2000. Ted and Carolyn moved to Europe where Ted served Cordiant’s design and branding group—Fitch:Worldwide—as Chief Creative Officer/Global in 2001 and 2002. His role included creative responsibility for 570 employees in 25 offices around the world. In 2003 Ted joined Schawk, Inc. where he held the position of President, Anthem Worldwide, a brand packaging consultancy with eight offices, through early 2005.</p>

<p>Ted has lectured and written on the subject of design and business for many organizations and publications including AIGA, APDF, IPA, PRSA, NIRI Communication Arts, How Magazine and Marketing. Today, Ted and Carolyn are consulting in the US and UK. They specialize in acquisitions, strategic positioning, partner communications, sales and marketing.</p>
