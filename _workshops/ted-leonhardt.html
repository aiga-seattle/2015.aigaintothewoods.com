<p>If youâ€™re a designer, you've likely felt tempted to compromise when it comes to talking about the dollars and deadlines of a project. But you can learn to overcome this tendency under the guidance of Ted Leonhardt, creator of the Worth It skills learning program. With over four decades of experience at the negotiation table, Ted has identified the struggles shared by many designers, and has advice on how to avoid them.</p>

<p>Ted Leonhardt cofounded The Leonhardt Group (now FITCH), a brand design agency, in 1985. When it sold in 1999, the company had fifty employees and $10 million in annual fee sales. Since then, Ted has written for publications including Communication Arts, HOW Magazine and FastCompany.com. He has presented at the University of Washington, SVC Seattle, and Seattle Central Creative Academy. Today, he consults with small design firms on business strategy, but the work he enjoys most is empowering designers and illustrators to ask for and get the wages they deserve.</p>
