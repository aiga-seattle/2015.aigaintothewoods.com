<p>Workshop brought by <a href="http://adobe.com">Adobe</a>.</p>

<p>With the advent of so many mobile devices, technology is offering more and more solutions to aid in our creative processes. In this workshop, we’ll discuss the creative process, then take a (short) walk in the woods to capture color, imagery, and more with your mobile device—that we’ll then incorporate directly into a design. Come take a walk outside, gain a new perspective for a design challenge, and learn a thing or two about using technology to aid your creative process.</p>
