The Workshop Workshop: Building the foundation for great projects.
<p>At the beginning of every project there is a unique moment to set the tone for the rest of the engagement and get everyone on the same page: the workshop. Knowing how to set up and run effective workshops is rarely taught in school and yet might be one of the highest-impact, lowest-effort skills you can learn to make you a better designer/manager/badass. In just a couple hours Leslie will teach a format and set of exercises to get disparate teams aligned, set expectations, build trust, and identify the foundational elements of whatever youâ€™ll be building as a team (and have fun doing it).</p>

<p>As a Workshop workshop, the idea is that attendees will learn how to run a series of activities by actually doing them. Each activity is aimed at building a different part of a solid project foundation. In the end, the goal is to walk away from the session with the ability to run a successful workshop of your own.</p>
