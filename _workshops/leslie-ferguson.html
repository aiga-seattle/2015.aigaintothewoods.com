<p>At the beginning of every project there is a unique moment to set the tone for the rest of the engagement and get everyone on the same page: the workshop. Knowing how to set up and run effective workshops is rarely taught in school and yet might be one of the highest-impact, lowest-effort skills you can learn to make you a better designer/manager/badass. In just a couple hours Leslie will teach a format and set of exercises to get disparate teams aligned, set expectations, build trust, and identify the foundational elements of whatever you’ll be building as a team.</p>

<p>Leslie is a senior user experience designer at Tectonic specializing in product strategy and envisioning. She has made a career of using her creative energy to influence and inspire teams through design. For balance, Leslie enjoys learning new things that don’t involve screens such as improv comedy, woodworking, abstract drawing and pottery.</p>
